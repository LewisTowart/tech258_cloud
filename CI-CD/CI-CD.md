# CI/CD

continuous integration continuous delivery

ci/cd automate the steps of sdlc, release the software faster, save time, save money

if code is deployed live for users (jenkins can do this if tests pass) if delivered it is pushed but not live/started

movie released it's finished delivered to cinema a week before but not live time to stop it if there's an issue.

everyhting we create in jenkins is called a job
