# Cloud

### What is cloud computing? 

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing servicesâ€”including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet.

#### So what does this really mean?

Imagine you have a giant storage space like a warehouse filled with lots of computers, servers, and other equipment. These computers are not physically in your home or office but are located in a specialized facility maintained by a company.

Now, instead of buying and owning your own computers and servers, you can use the ones in this giant storage space whenever you need them. You can access these computers over the internet from your own device, like a desktop,  laptop or phone.

Cloud computing is like renting these computers on demand (whenever you need them). You pay for the computing power and storage space you use, similar to paying for electricity or water usage at your home.

This way, you don't need to worry about buying expensive hardware, setting it up, maintaining it or from personal experience messing up any of these steps. You can focus on using the computing resources you need for your work or projects, and you can scale up or down as needed without having to invest in new equipment.

### How do we know if something is in the cloud? Differences between on-prem and the cloud?

There are a few different deciding factors to whether something is considered in the cloud or on-prem (on premise).

Here are some examples to demonstrate the difference:

**Location of Resources**
* On-prem: All hardware, servers, and infrastructure are physically located within your organization's premises, such as in your own data center or server room.
* Cloud: The hardware and infrastructure are located off-site, typically in data centers owned and maintained by cloud service providers (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform).

**Ownership and Management**
* On-prem: Your organisation is responsible for purchasing, configuring, managing, and maintaining all hardware, servers, networking equipment and software licenses.
* Cloud: The infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud service provider. This includes hardware maintenance, software updates, security, and scalability. Users typically pay for the resources they consume on a subscription basis.

**Scalability and Flexibility**
* On-prem: Scaling resources in an on-prem environment often requires purchasing and installing additional hardware, which can be time-consuming and costly.
* Cloud: Cloud computing offers scalability and flexibility, allowing users to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand. This elasticity enables organisations to handle fluctuations in workload without the need for significant upfront investment.

To summarise, while on-prem computing offers full control and ownership of infrastructure, cloud computing provides agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness by leveraging off-site resources managed by cloud service providers. Determining whether something is in the cloud or on-prem involves understanding where the computing resources are located and who is responsible for managing them.

### The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud

**Private Cloud**

A private cloud is a cloud environment dedicated exclusively to a single organisation. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party service provider.

Private cloud proves full control over the resources and infrastructure used. It offers enhanced security due to the resources not being shared. It also allows for customisation to meet you organisations specific needs.

**How does it work**

Organisations build and manage their private cloud infrastructure, either on-prem or through a managed hosting provider. They deploy virtualization technologies and cloud management tools to create a scalable and flexible environment for their workloads.

**Public Cloud**

A public cloud is a cloud environment owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider. Resources are shared among multiple organisations and users on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Public cloud offers virtually unlimited scalability and on demand resources. It's cost effective as most pricing models are pay as you go.

**How does it work**

Organisations leverage the infrastructure and services provided by public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. They can deploy and manage applications, data, and services without the need for upfront investment in hardware or infrastructure.

**Hybrid Cloud**

A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud environments that are interconnected and work together seamlessly.

Offers flexibility working across both public and private clouds based on requirements. Scalable due to leveraging resources from both cloud types. Can allow the movement of data between public and private cloud spaces.

**How does it work**

Organisations integrate and orchestrate their public and private cloud environments using hybrid cloud management tools and technologies. They can run workloads in the most suitable environment based on factors such as performance, security, compliance, and cost.

**Multi-Cloud**

A multi-cloud strategy involves using multiple cloud service providers to meet different business needs or avoid vendor lock-in.

Offers a broader range of cloud services providing different features. Distributes workload increasing resilience and mitigating certain risks. Can allow your organisation to optimise which cloud provider is used for what to save the most money.

**How does it work**

Organisations deploy and manage workloads across multiple cloud platforms simultaneously. They may use different providers for specific services or applications, such as using one provider for compute services and another for storage services.

### Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS - What are differences?

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, allowing users to access and manage infrastructure components such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

PaaS provides a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, allowing users to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**

SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, allowing users to access and use applications hosted in the cloud without the need for installation or maintenance.

**Conclusion**

In summary, IaaS provides virtualized infrastructure components, PaaS offers a development and deployment platform for applications and SaaS delivers complete software applications over the internet. The main differences lie in the level of abstraction, management responsibility, and scalability options provided by each type of cloud service. Organisations choose the appropriate service model based on their requirements, technical expertise, and desired level of control.

### What are the advantages/disadvantages of the cloud? (Particularly for a business)

**Advantages**
* Scalability: Cloud computing offers scalability, allowing businesses to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand.
* Cost-Efficiency: Cloud computing operates on a pay-as-you-go or subscription-based pricing model, eliminating the need for upfront capital investment in hardware and infrastructure.
* Flexibility: Cloud computing provides flexibility, allowing businesses to access resources and services from anywhere with an internet connection. 
* Availability: Cloud service providers offer high levels of reliability and availability through redundant infrastructure, data replication and failover mechanisms.
* Security: Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures to protect data and infrastructure from cyber threats.

**Disadvantages**
* Data Privacy: Businesses must ensure compliance with data protection regulations and assess the risks associated with storing data off-premises.
* Dependence on Internet Connectivity: Cloud computing relies on internet connectivity for access to resources and services.
* Vendor Lock-In: Adopting cloud services from a specific provider may result in vendor lock-in, making it challenging to migrate to alternative platforms or exit the cloud environment.
* Performance Variability: Performance in the cloud can be subject to variability due to factors such as network latency, shared resources, and geographic location.
* Data Transfer Costs: Transferring data to and from the cloud may incur additional costs, especially for large volumes of data or frequent transfers. 


### Difference between OpEx vs CapEx and how it relates the cloud

***Operational Expenditure (OpEx)***

OpEx refers to ongoing expenses incurred by a business for day-to-day operations and maintenance. These expenses are typically recurring and are recorded on the income statement as operating expenses.

This could be:
* Salaries
* Utilities
* Rent
* Subscriptions

**Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**

CapEx refers to investments made by a business in assets that provide long-term benefits and generate revenue over an extended period. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets and are typically depreciated over their useful life.

This could be:
* Land
* Infrastructure
* Buildings
* Tech Investments

**Relation to the Cloud?**
Businesses typically incur OpEx for cloud services on a subscription basis, while CapEx may be involved in initial setup, migration, or certain investments related to cloud infrastructure and development.

To summarise, OpEx refers to ongoing operational expenses incurred for day-to-day business operations, while CapEx refers to investments in assets that provide long-term value.

### Is migrating to the cloud always cheaper?

The short answer is No. The answer of is it cheaper will be specific to each organisation's current state and requirements.

Here are some examples to show how it may be more costly for a business:
* The business may have already heavily invested in their infrastructure
* A business may have a consistent workload and doesn't need some of the benefits of cloud such as scalability
* Even though most pay models are pay as you go a smaller business may have no need to use the cloud
* An organisation may not be effectively utilising the resources they are paying a cloud provider for
* There can be additional costs for transferring data to and from the cloud

### Marketshare - What is the breakdown? 

The market share of the cloud environment is dominated by three big players these are:
* AWS (Amazon) - Holding around 33% of the current market

### Which cloud provider do you think might be the best? Why?

Deciding which cloud provider is the best can be a difficult questions to answer. From my personal learning I would say that it very much depends on th requirements of the organisation itself. Making a conclusive report on what you are actually wanting to use the cloud for and what it can achieve for you business.

If I had to choose just one I think the safe option seems to be AWS. It holds most of the features that are provided by the other cloud services and holds the most market share. I think the well adopted use of AWS is important as it means there will more than likely be a much larger community available to troubleshoot any issues and bounce new ideas off.
